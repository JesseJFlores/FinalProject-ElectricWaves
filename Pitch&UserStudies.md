# FINAL PROJECT PITCH

## Site Name:

**_Electric Waves_**

## Who is the site for?

The sites content will primarily be directed towards novice recordists but will also contain information for advanced engineers.

## What problem am I solving?

Learning to mix music on a professional level is a tedious journey. Without direction, it can take years to fumble your way through bad practices to get to the good ones and I would like to help speed up that process.

## How am I going to solve this problem?

Drawing from my personal experiences and of those around me- particularly the not so great experiences that led to the development of bad habits- I intend to provide access to appropriate video tutorials, articles and software reviews that will help steer new recordists in the right direction.

## Why is my solution going to work?

This will work because this is a very popular field and people turn to the internet for information. I will provide a clear and concise site for those people to find answers- from someone who has been through the same process.

# USER STUDIES

## Elevator Pitch

I would like to build a site that brings together video tutorials along with blogs/articles about audio production.

## The 5 W's

This site will be for aspiring, novice recordists as well as advanced engineers. I have been through the incredibly lengthy and confusing process of learning how to mix and master, and it is quite daunting. I'd like to help speed up the process for others by sharing my experiences, trials and tribulations.

## BASIC FEATURES/CONTENT

* video tutorials  
* resources (articles/interviews)  
* plug-in reviews
* microphones
* feedback form

## SITE MAP

1. HOME PAGE   
1. VIDEOS    
1. PLUG INS
1. MICROPHONES
1. RESOURCES
1. FEEDBACK

## LIBRARIES/SPECIAL FEATURES

* Google Fonts/Type Kit
* Bootstrap or Bourbon and Neat, or possibly just Flexbox
* Font Awesome or Material Design

## MVP

At the very least I will need branding that includes a logo (icon and typographical), a color scheme and a body font plus header font. There will need to be a HOME page, a VIDEOS page, a PLUG-IN page, a MICROPHONES page, a RESOURCES page, and a FEEDBACK page. The home page will feature one of the latest additions to the main categories- a video, one plug-in review, and an article/link to an external resource/site- this way the user can immediately engage with the content upon initially viewing the site. The user can then select a link from the navigation to further view more specific content- i.e., tutorials, featured plug-ins, and a list of all resources for learning (links to external sites or articles). The site will need to be responsive so it can properly be viewed from any device.

## USER STORIES
