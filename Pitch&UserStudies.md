# FINAL PROJECT PITCH

## Site Name:

**_Electric Waves_**

## Who is the site for?

The sites content will initially be directed towards novice recordists. Eventually the site will contain tutorials for more advanced engineers.

## What problem am I solving?

Learning to mix music on a professional level is a tedious journey. Without direction, it can take years to fumble your way through bad practices to get to the good ones and I would like to help speed up that process.

## How am I going to solve this problem?

Drawing from my personal experiences and of those around me- particularly the not so great experiences that led to the development of bad habits- I intend to provide access to appropriate video tutorials, articles and software reviews that will help steer new recordists in the right direction.

## Why is my solution going to work?

This will work because this is a very popular field and people turn to the internet for information. I will provide a clear and concise site for those people to find answers- from someone who has been through the same process.

# USER STUDIES

## Elevator Pitch

I would like to build a site that brings together video tutorials along with blogs/articles for novice recordists about audio production.

## The 5 W's

This site will be for aspiring, novice recordists, and eventually as well as advanced engineers. I have been through the incredibly lengthy and confusing process of learning how to record, mix and master, and it is quite daunting. I'd like to help speed up the process for others by sharing my experiences, trials and tribulations.

## BASIC FEATURES/CONTENT

* video tutorials  
* resources (articles/interviews)  
* plug-in reviews
* microphone basics
* feedback form

## SITE MAP

1. HOME PAGE   
1. VIDEOS    
1. PLUG INS
1. MICROPHONES
1. RESOURCES
1. FEEDBACK

## LIBRARIES/SPECIAL FEATURES

* Google Fonts/Type Kit
* Bootstrap or Bourbon and Neat, or possibly just Flexbox
* Font Awesome or Material Design

## MVP

At the very least I will need branding that includes a logo (icon and typographical), a color scheme and a body font plus header font. There will need to be a **HOME** page, a **VIDEOS** page, a **PLUG-IN** page, a **MICROPHONES** page, a **RESOURCES** page, and a **FEEDBACK** page. The home page will feature one of the latest additions to the main categories- a video, one plug-in review, and an article/link to an external resource/site- this way the user can immediately engage with the content upon initially viewing the site. The user can then select a link from the navigation to further view more specific content- i.e., tutorials, featured plug-ins, and a list of all resources for learning (links to external sites or articles). The site will need to be responsive so it can properly be viewed from any device.

# PERSONAS

## Persona 1: "Andrew"

_Profile:_ Musician- Guitar/Vocals  
_Gender:_ Male  
_Age:_ 30  
_Location:_ Houston, Tx  
_Job Title:_ Sales, Music Education $30k

_Description:_

Andrew works at a local music shop and sells guitars. He also teaches guitar lessons. He's been a musician since he was a young boy and he has played in many bands who have spent time in studios making demo's/albums of their original material. He does not have much experience doing any of the engineering or mixing himself.

_Goals:_

Wants to write songs and record them himself.  
Wants to learn about recording and mixing music with computers.

_Frustrations:_

Doesn't know anyone who can show him the way and does not have time/money to go to school for audio.  

## Persona 2: "Laura"

_Profile:_ Musician- Keys/Vocals  
_Gender:_ Female   
_Age:_ 16  
_Location:_ Austin, Tx  
_Job Title:_ Student

_Description:_

Laura has been taking piano and voice lessons since she was 5 years old. She is now writing her own songs and would like to be able to record them at home. She has a Mac, an audio interface, a decent microphone, and she likes to use Apple's Logic recording software. She is pretty good with computers so she has been able to do a lot of learning by trial and error, and likes to experiment with new techniques. She is looking for a place where she can learn even more.  

_Goals:_

She would like to make her demo's sound more like professional recordings.

_Frustrations:_

All of the sites she visits want her to pay for a membership and a lot of the free videos on YouTube are poor quality and confusing.

## Persona 3: "Kevin"

_Profile:_ Audio Engineer  
_Gender:_ Male   
_Age:_ 23
_Location:_ NYC
_Job Title:_ Intern at a recording studio

_Description:_

Kevin is fresh out of school for audio engineering. He is overwhelmed by the amount of information he just took in over the duration of the two year course and needs help really understanding all of the different concepts. He takes an unpaid internship at a local studio so he can keep learning and in his spare time he surfs the web for good tutorials and practices recording and mixing at home. He frequently takes on free projects for friends.

_Goals:_

Wants to reiterate the things he learned in school to better understand them so he can implement them quickly and easily.  

He wants to impress the head engineer at the studio.

_Frustrations:_

Has a hard time learning things the first time, but is no longer in school. His time as an intern in the studio is valuable but does not want to interrupt the sessions every time he has a question.
